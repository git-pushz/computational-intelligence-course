## Server

The server accepts passing objects provided in GameData.py back and forth to the clients.
Each object has a ```serialize()``` and a ```deserialize(data: str)``` method that must be used to pass the data between server and client.

Commands for server:

+ exit: exit from the server

## Client

Commands for client:

+ exit: exit from the game
+ ready: set your status to ready (lobby only)
+ show: show cards
+ hint \<type> \<destinatary> \<cards>:
  + type: 'color' or 'value'
  + destinatary: name of the person you want to ask the hint to
  + cards: the cards you are addressing to. They start from 0 and are shown in the hand order. (this will probably be removed in a later version)
+ discard \<num>: discard the card *num* (\[0-4]) from your hand
